# rmBlueThings

### The upgrade to RemoveBlueStuff
(I lost the source code)

### Usage
Drag and drop files and folders onto exe file. <br>
This will create new images in the same places with the same name, <br>
but with "-b" added just before the extension. <br>
<br>
To use this program with another color, <br>
create a file called "newColor" in the same directory, <br>
and add a hex color in the format of [RRGGBBAA].
<br>
This program will overwrite the originals by default.<br>
To disable this, create a file called "keepOrigin"
