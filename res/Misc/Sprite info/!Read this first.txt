Hi I (Christian/ChippieX) put together a bunch of these spritesheets here (like the explosions, projectiles, etc) and
to use them in the code my friends asked me to put them together in a certian way.

I did not really work with the code directly, so i do not know if these information files are still important.
Just to be sure, I included them here. You can find some of the info in the code, but I'll list it here to be safe.

SOME OF THE INFO IS NOT HERE, CHECK THE COMMIT HISTORY FOR THE PROJECT ON GITHUB.
For smaller spritesheets, I put all of the info in the commit message where I uploaded it.
If the info is not in a text file or commit message, check the code. If its still missing,
you might need to measure the sprite size yourself. Sorry in advance :/

Here is how I set up the sheets:

sprites are grouped together horizontally across left to right (ex: exposion animations are frame by frame
left to right.)

all sprites in a group share a fixed size, even if they have transparency around the edges.
this makes it a lot easier to animate in the code. (ex: each rocket sprite in the first group
is in a 13x13 box, despite not all of them being 13 tall or wide.)

for all images I made (list included at the bottom,) there is NO buffer between the individual sprites
in a group (so horizontally) HOWEVER there is one vertically.

Spritesheets I made:

Enemy projectiles
Japan lazer
Missles
Money
Powerups
Projectiles
Specials
Stop

I used Photopea to make all of these, its a great free website, very helpful for us.
