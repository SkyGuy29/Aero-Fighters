# Aero-Fighters
Our multi-month-long final project for our year two C++ programming class
and the reintroduction to our year three programming class, 
an as close replica to the original Aero Fighters arcade game as we could create.
Made using SFML.

If any project member sees this, Christian is terribly sorry for any pain or stress this has caused.
there are absolutely no easter eggs or inside jokes in this project because we are good and
hardworking students at all times no matter what. Do not go and fact-check this claim.
